    <h4>Malaysian Food</h4>
    <h3>Nasi Kerabu</h3>
    <img class="center" src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.7Y28uxbFsTNm8fyz2Zq8TgHaEK?w=308&h=180&c=7&o=5&dpr=1.5&pid=1.7">
    <p><em>Nasi kerabu is a Malaysian cuisine rice dish
       A type of nasi ulam, in which blue-colored rice is eaten with
       fried fish or fried chicken, crackers, pickles and other salads.
       The blue color of the rice comes from the petals of Clitoria ternatea (butterfly-pea)
       flowers (bunga telang), which are used as a natural food coloring in cooking it.
       The rice can also be cooked with plain white rice or rice cooked using turmeric.
       It is often eaten with solok lada and is also eaten with fried keropok.</em>

    <h3>Nasi Kandar</h3>
    <img  class="center" src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.0m5YkWUmq7SliC6E6c5DsgHaFV?w=271&h=196&c=7&o=5&dpr=1.5&pid=1.7">
    <p><em>Nasi kandar is a popular northern Malaysian dish, which originates from Penang. It was popularized by Tamil Muslim traders from India.
       It is a meal of steamed rice which can be plain or mildly flavored, and served with a variety of curries and side dishes
       The rice for a nasi kandar dish is often placed in a wooden container about three feet high, giving it a distinctive aroma.
       The rice is accompanied by side dishes such as fried chicken, curried beef spleen, cubed beef, lamb, fish roe, fried prawns or fried squid.
       The vegetable dish would usually be (brinjal or "terong") (aubergine), okra (lady fingers or "bhindi") or bitter gourd.
       A mixture of curry sauces is poured on the rice. This is called 'banjir' (flooding) and imparts a diverse taste to the rice.
       Traditionally, nasi kandar is always served with its side dishes on a single plate.
       Nowadays, small melamine bowls are used for the side dishes. Nevertheless, the curry sauce mix is always poured directly onto the rice.</em>

    <p><em>Nasi dagang is a Malaysian dish consisting of rice steamed in coconut milk, fish curry and extra ingredients such as pickled cucumber and carrots.
       It is a well-known breakfast food in the states on the East Coast of Peninsular Malaysia (Terengganu, Kelantan, parts of Pahang and eastern Johor),
       southern Thai Malay provinces of Pattani, Yala and Narathiwat and across the Indonesian border in Natuna and Anambas, Riau Islands.
       The most famous nasi dagang comes from Tumpat in Kelantan and Kampung Ladang in Kuala Terengganu.</em>

    <h3>Nasi Lemak</h3>
    <img  class="center" src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.QFAXX7z1EdlatO9T36AAQgHaE8?w=234&h=180&c=7&o=5&dpr=1.5&pid=1.7">
    <p><em>Nasi lemak is a Malay cuisine dish consisting of fragrant rice cooked in coconut milk and pandan leaf. It is commonly found in Malaysia,
      where it is considered the national dish; it is also the native dish in neighbouring areas with significant Malay populations such as Singapore; Brunei, and Southern Thailand.
      In Indonesia it can be found in several parts of Sumatra; especially Malay realm of Riau, Riau Islands and Medan.
      Nasi lemak can also be found in the Bangsamoro region of Mindanao prepared by Filipino Moro. It is considered one of the most famous dishes for a
      Malay-style breakfast. It is not to be confused with nasi dagang, sold in the Malaysian east coast states of Terengganu and Kelantan
      (and its kindred region in Pattani, Yala and Narathiwat in Thailand and Natuna in Indonesia), although both dishes are often served for breakfast.
      However, because nasi lemak can be served in a variety of ways, it is often eaten throughout the day.</em>

    <p><em>Mee goreng mamak is a versatile stir-fry noodle dish from the Maritime Southeast Asia region, initially introduced by the Indian-Muslim community.
      It is a spicy-savory course that pairs the noodles with a combination of fish cakes, chicken, prawns, garlic, scallions, tomato sauce, curry spice,
      sweet soy sauce, boiled potatoes, and eggs.For toppings, the most commonly used are red chilies, crispy fried onions, and lime juice.
      Traditionally, the dish is served alongside calamansi wedges - a citrus hybrid native to the region (can be substituted with lime wedges).
      Mee goreng mamak is a favorite in Malaysia and can be found everywhere, from street vendors to sit-down restaurants.</em>

    <h3>Laksa Penang</h3>
    <img  class="center" src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.kKKzfP7ls9qOpJcD-qD8RgHaFj?w=259&h=194&c=7&o=5&dpr=1.5&pid=1.7" alt="laksa penang">
    <p><em>Penang laksa (Malay: Laksa Pulau Pinang), also known as asam laksa from the Malay for tamarind, comes from the Malaysian island of Penang.
      It is made with mackerel (ikan kembung) soup and its main distinguishing feature is the asam or tamarind which gives the soup a sour taste.
      The fish is poached and then flaked. Other ingredients that give Penang laksa its distinctive flavour include lemongrass, galangal(lengkuas) and chilli.
      Typical garnishes include mint, pineapple slices, thinly sliced onion, hε-ko, a thick sweet prawn paste and use of torch ginger flower.
      This, and not 'curry mee' is the usual 'laksa' one gets in Penang</em>

    <h3>Roti Jala</h3>
    <img  class="center" src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.ru2fzfYOIAD82Yt5kDtwOwHaFj?w=232&h=180&c=7&o=5&dpr=1.5&pid=1.7" alt="roti jala">
    <p><em>Roti Jala is the lesser known and more elusive cousin of the famed Roti Canai. In Malaysia, you are more likely to eat these net crepes at a social
      gathering than in a restaurant. It is especially popular during Hari Raya Aidil Fitri (Eid) and traditional kenduri (Malay feast) to mark auspicious
      events like weddings. Growing up, I looked forward to this treat during Hari Raya. When translated, Roti Jala literally means “net bread” because
      of its lacy or net-like appearance. Well made Roti Jala is tender and delicate. It should never be brown or crispy. They are usually served with
      Chicken Curry, Beef Rendang (caramelized beef curry), or serunding daging (spicy beef floss).</em>

    <h3>Ayam Percik</h3>
    <img  class="center" src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.q_8JZ0KOW4DDPpbVGEiZZAHaEL?w=317&h=180&c=7&o=5&dpr=1.5&pid=1.7" alt="ayam percik">
    <p><em>Ayam Percik, a Malaysian grilled or roasted chicken marinated in flavorful spices like turmeric, cumin & coriander along with lemongrass,
       coconut milk & tamarind. As the chicken is roasted, the marinade caramelizes on the meat lending a delicious coating that will blow your mind.</em>

    <h3>Rendang</h3>
    <img  class="center" src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.jRrAoJr1y1lqmpcjxlz_eQHaE8?w=295&h=197&c=7&o=5&dpr=1.5&pid=1.7">
    <p><em>Rendang is a popular dish of meat stewed in coconut milk and spices, commonly found in Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia. It has a long
      history in the region with distinct versions unique to individual Malaysian states that use different ingredients for the rempah
      (Malay for “spice mix”), thus resulting in differing flavours to the meat. Rendang is rich in spices; next to main meat ingredient, rendang
      uses coconut milk (Minangkabau: karambia ), and mixture of ground spices paste, which include ginger, galangal, turmeric leaves, lemon grass,
      garlic, shallot, chillies and other spices. These spices are called pemasak in Minangkabau language.</em>
