    <p><em>This Thai Omelet recipe is a great vegetarian version of Thailand’s popular Kai Jeow street food. Ready in just 5 minutes with a few simple ingredients,
     it makes a great breakfast, lunch or light dinner.
     It is typically made with fish sauce, so if you eat fish, then substitute it for the soy sauce for a more traditional version. I love how the soy sauce
     gives just as good a umami flavor though.</em>

    <p><em>The full name of this dish is Gai Pad Med Ma-Muang Hima-Pan. Gai Pad Med Ma-Muang (literally, Chicken stir-frys with cashew nuts)
    This dish is like many Thai dishes that we adopted from Chinese cuisine, it is original from high end Chinese restaurants, serve in a crispy deep

    and sour pork were the same dish – one of Cantonese Chinese dishes</em>

    <p><em>This authentic Khao Soi Recipe makes a fantastic and individual style of curry from Northern Thailand and one of our favorite Thai curries because it is full of flavor, each mouthful different from the last.
    It’s a great dish to cook at home because it is unusual and exciting to look at and each mouthful seems unique. You are what you eat, so when you cook at home you can choose the best ingredients for your meals unlike when you eat outside.</em>

    <p><em>The pink noodle soup yen ta fo (yen ta fo) is a popular bowl among locals and you find it all over Bangkok. It gets it color from fermented been curd and not ketchup and tomatoes as some think. At best it’s a fantastic dish, but most vendors serves a rather mediocre bowl or worse, with far to much sweetness. Yen Ta Fo What Khaek avoids the trap and serves a good bowl with distinct tartness.</em>

    <p><em>Yum Talay is a spicy seafood salad. Yum means to combine hot and sour ingredients. Talay means the sea.
    I love anything spicy and seafood. I mean, what an amazing combination for the palate!
    Yum means to combine hot and sour ingredients. Talay means the sea. I love anything spicy and seafood. I mean, what an amazing combination for the palate! This is by far my favorite salad, next to papaya salad. It has as similar taste to papaya salad, spicy, sour, sweet and salty. The flavors are perfectly balanced and compliments the seafood.</em>

    <p><em>Phanaeng (Thai: พะแนง, pronounced [pʰā.nɛ̄ːŋ]), also spelled phanang, panang, and other variants) is a type of red Thai curry that is thick, salty and sweet, with a zesty kaffir lime flavour[1]. The earliest known mention of phanaeng appears in Mom Somchin Rachanupraphan's book Tamra Kap Khao (ตำรากับเข้า), published in 1890.
    A popular phanaeng curry dish is pork phanaeng.[citation needed] For vegetarians and vegans, there are vegetarian/vegan alternatives made with imitation shrimp paste called kapi chae in Thailand, and the fish sauce can be substituted with a strong vegetable stock or soy sauce. Tofu can be used in place of meat. In Thailand, this curry is usually eaten with ric</em>

    <p><em>The fish is fluffed up and fried until golden and crispy. The savoury crunch is contrasted by the fresh tart green mango salad—it’s truly a match made in heaven and there are no other dishes quite like it.
    Traditionally this dish uses Thai charcoal-grilled catfish (pla duk yang), which is widely available on the streets of Thailand. But considering what we’re doing to it, it really doesn’t matter much which kind of fish you use, and indeed Thai people routinely use various other types of fish when the catfish isn’t available.</em>
