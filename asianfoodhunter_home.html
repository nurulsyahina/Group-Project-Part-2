        <h2>VIRAL FOODS 2020</h2>
        <p>Who said you can only try trendy food at restaurants? As nations continue to exert efforts to curb the spread of the new coronavirus (COVID-19) getting a food fix outside has become trickier, if not impossible. So why not try your hand at making something delicious while in quarantine? Not only is it a great boredom buster—it also keeps your mind off the stressful situation that the world is currently facing.</p>
        <p>Channel your inner master chef with these easy recipes of viral food trends that you can try making at home!</p>

        <h3>Dalgona Coffee</h3>
        <iframe  class="center" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9SjCEOWd3PU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p><em>Dalgona coffee is a beverage made by whipping equal proportions of instant coffee powder, sugar, and hot water until it becomes creamy and then adding
          it to cold or hot milk. Occasionally, it is topped with coffee powder, cocoa, crumbled biscuits, or honey.</em></p>
        <h3>Cloud Bread </h3>
        <p><iframe  class="center" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZIu8i1kSUgQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
        <p><em>Cloud bread is soft and fluffy - like a cloud! It's a great substitute for 'regular' bread and is low in carbs. Although it's not firm enough to replace bread in a regular sandwich,
            I like to top one 'slice' with peanut butter and bananas, toast it with jam or with my favorite lunch meat and fillings!</em></p>
        <h3>Steak Ramdon </h3>
        <p><iframe class="center" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ya7LBYFN-kI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
        <p><em>Ramdon, which is a portmanteau of ramyun + udon, is basically jjapaguri (짜파구리) with steak. And if you need me to break it down further,
            jjapaguri is Chapaghetti + Neoguri ramyun from Nongshim.</em></p>
        <h3>Chocolate Banana Bread </h3>
        <p><iframe class="center" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5h_4apLQ3wU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
        <p><em>Dear banana bread lovers, putting chocolate chips in your banana bread is like having your bananas and chocolate go on a date.
          Lovely and sweet, yet still separate and distinct. After a while both want something more—a merging of wills, a commitment!
          If chocolate and banana were to marry, this would be the result—a richly chocolate banana bread, infused with cocoa, speckled with chocolate chips,
          with warm hints of butter, vanilla, and allspice.</em></p></h3>
        <h3>Mini Pancakes </h3>
        <p><iframe class="center" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TToUMBEmsIk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
        <p><em>Mini Pancakes, also known as Pancake Cereal, are the best new thing to happen to breakfast. Serving up bite-size fluffy pancakes breakfast cereal style brings an unexpected
            twist and a whole lot of fun to family breakfasts and brunches.</em></p>
        <h3>Basque Burnt Cheesecake</h3>
        <p><iframe class="center" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KQbjTT1num0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
        <p><em>Basque cheesecake got its start at La Viña Bar in San Sebastián, Spain about 30 years ago. It's got the foundation of a basic cheesecake recipe, using a combo of cream cheese, heavy cream, eggs, and sugar. The only differences here are a lack of
          crust and the burnt topping. Just creamy, smooth cheesecake. To achieve the burnt exterior, Basque cheesecake is baked at a high temperature for a short time.</em></p>
        <h3>Cream Cheese Garlic Bread</h3>
        <p><iframe class="center" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JjH2sGvuAKk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
        <p><em>Korean cream cheese garlic bread is a popular Korean street food featuring a twist on classic garlic bread. Rather than using loaves of bread, this garlic bread uses medium size rolls, about 5 inches wide,
          that's been cut into wedges. The bread is filled with sweetened cream cheese and a dunked in a garlic butter "custard."</em></p>
