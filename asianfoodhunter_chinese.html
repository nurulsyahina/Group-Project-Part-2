    <h4>Chinese Food</h4>

    <p><em>Dim sum is an integral part of Chinese cuisine, closely associated with the tradition of yum cha, or taking tea. This type of food can be found all over China and in many parts of the West, where it is a popular meal. Most people eat dim sum is usually served in the late morning through the early afternoon, although some establishments serving it are open later. It is a meal that should be lingered over, in multiple courses that traditionally have a set order.</em></p>
    <p><em>Dim sum is an umbrella category for small Chinese dishes. Typical examples of this food are small dumplings, wrapped foods such as won tons and egg rolls, and other foods. In general, individual portions of dim sum are small, so that numerous dishes can be ordered and sampled by the table. Most dim sum falls under the category of a savory pastry, although these foods can be prepared in a variety of ways. Dim sum can be steamed, fried, boiled, baked, or broiled, and this wide range of options makes for a lively and varied meal.</em></p>

    <h3>Egg Drop Soup <br>

    <p><em>Egg drop soup is a Chinese soup of wispy beaten eggs in boiled chicken broth. Condiments such as black or white pepper, and finely chopped scallions and tofu are optional, but commonly added to the soup. The soup is finished by adding a thin stream of beaten eggs to the boiling broth in the final moments of cooking, creating thin, silken strands or flakes of cooked egg that float in the soup.</em></p>

    <h3>Soy Braised Chicken <br>

    <p><em>Soy Braised Chicken is a Hong Kong style chicken dish which is slow braised over low fire in an aromatic stew of spices and dark soy sauce. It is typically served with noodles or rice.</em></p>

    <p><em>Use this easy recipe to make Chinese beef and peppers with a savory black bean sauce. This dish will not only make your mouth water, it is a staple of Cantonese home cooking. Chock-full of healthful ingredients such as garlic, ginger, and onions, it's a great meal to have if you're watching your weight or trying to make better culinary choices.</em></p>

    <h3>Kung Pao Shrimp <br>

    <p><em>Kung Pao shrimp is a sweet and spicy combination of fresh, crisp, sautéed veggies with shrimp. The sauce for this recipe combines a bit of broth with bold flavors from soy sauce, hoisin and sesame oil. A sprinkle of chili flakes add some heat (add a little or a lot).</em></p>

    <h3>Scrambled Egg with Tomato <br>

    <p><em>Scrambled Eggs with Tomatoes is the simplest, arguably and tastiest Home-style Chinese food. It takes only a few ingredients: eggs, tomatoes, salt and sugar for flavoring, and chopped scallions for garnishing. Some days we just made more soup of scrambled eggs with tomatoes and poured over the noodles to make the scrambled eggs with tomato noodle. It is satisfying and quick.
          Juicy tomatoes mingle with softly scrambled eggs in a saucy dish that’s delicious over rice or noodle. </em></p>

    <h3>Stir Fry Teochew Noodles <br>

    <p><em>This teochew noodles dish is very simple to cook and has only four ingredients in it. We need a fair bit of aromatic garlic, a handful of beansprouts and chinese chives and lastly the most important, pork fat. The noodles is unlike others as it is first stir-fried on its own in light lard oil until they sear properly. This can be quite laborious but the outcome is truly worth all the effort. Only then do we toss in the beansprouts.
          Another important ingredient is chinese chives. Without chives, the stir-fried longevity noodles is never complete so a handful of chinese chives is added as the last cooking step before garnishing with fried and chopped lard pieces and aromatic garlic.</em></p>

    <h3>Peking Roasted Duck <br>

    <p><em>Peking duck is a famous dish from Beijing, enjoying world fame, and considered as one of China’s national dishes.
          Peking duck is savored for its thin and crispy skin. The Sliced Peking duck is often eaten with pancakes, sweet bean sauce, or soy with mashed garlic. It is a must-taste dish in Beijing! </em></p>

    <h3>Steamed Vermicelli Rolls <br>

    <p><em>Steamed vermicelli rolls are definitely one of the must-orders of any dim sum meal! They are not only an expert choice in Guangzhou teahouses, morning tea restaurants, and street food night bazaars, but also a delicacy for many people's breakfasts in the rest of China’s middle-class restaurants.
          White sheets of rice starch are rolled with various fillings. Some popular choices are beef/pork, shrimp, even oyster, with mushroom, egg, lettuce, watercress etc. The rolls are steamed till all flavors blender together and then sprinkled with cooked peanut oil, raw soy sauce, chili sauce, or sesame paste depending on individual preferences.</em></p>
