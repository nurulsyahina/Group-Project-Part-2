        <h4>Asian Dessert</h4>
        <h3>Fistikli Sarma</h3>
        <img class="center" src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.N-SosrtUvDR5v9vaCdG4-QAAAA?w=232&h=171&c=7&o=5&dpr=1.5&pid=1.7" >
        <p><em>
            This Turkish sweet is made with a smooth, green, paste-like filling
            known as fıstık ezmesi (lit. pistachio butter). It is like a
            pistachio version of marzipan, and its bright green color is
            all-natural—it comes from the early-harvested Gaziantep pistachios.
            The delicious pistachio paste is wrapped around a single sheet of
            phyllo dough, just to hold its green goodness together, which is why
            this type of baklava is called either fıstıklı sarma or fıstıklı
            dürüm, meaning pistachio wrap or pistachio roll.</em>

        <p><em>Panjiri is a popular Indian dessert consisting of whole-wheat flour, ghee, sugar, dried fruits, and herbal gums.
          It is traditionally offered to new mothers after delivery because panjiri is also regarded as a nutritional supplement.
          The dish is especially popular during winter, since it is believed that panjiri will ward off colds.There are numerous variations on the dish with added ingredients such as lotus seeds, melon seeds, dried coconut, ginger, or poppy seeds. </em>

        <p><em>If you think that travelling around Asia means you might encounter a few “dodgy” foods, then fear not, as in Vietnam they have simple banana cakes – known as Bánh Chuối Nướng – that have been baked to perfection. Fresh banana cakes that have been freshly baked? Sounds good to me!. </em>
